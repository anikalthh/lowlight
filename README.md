# Lowlight

Lowlight is a mental well-being app that focuses on providing a safe space for users to share their struggles and worries. Unlike social media, where we are constantly stimulated and exposed to the highs and exciting parts of everyone's lives, Lowlight cultivates the practice of sharing raw, unfiltered experiences with others.

## Features:

- **Forum:**
  - Users can create channels, posts, and comment on each other's posts.

- **Personal Journal:**
  - All posts made in the personal journal cannot be accessed by other users.

- **Inspiration Quote:**
  - A new inspiration quote is generated on a user's profile page every time it refreshes.

- **Mood Tracker:**
  - Track and analyze your mood over time.

- **Mental Well-being Chatbot:**
  - Powered by OpenAI GPT-3.5 model, offering support and conversation.

- **REST API:**
  - View user information in JSON format (primarily for moderators, added as a navbar placeholder for ease of web app demo).
