      "body": "Today was my first day at university. It was both exciting and nerve-wracking. Here are some of my tips that helped me overcome my first-day jitters as a socially anxious individual: <br><br> 1. I joined a couple of student clubs and societies before the actual first day of school so that I got to meet people of similar interests! This really helped me since we naturally decided to take certain modules together. <br><br> 2. Look through your modules a few days before your first week of official lessons as it helps give you an overview of what you will be learning in class! This helps me retain information much better. <br><br> 3. Go for the open house! It's good to be familiar with your faculty and general campus layout so you don't get lost on your first day. <br><br> Good luck!",

      "author": "adrinalyh",
      "body": "College relationships can be tricky but I've learned that open communication is key. Here are some experiences and advice on navigating college relationships. <br><br> During my first year, I realized the importance of establishing clear communication from the start. It's crucial to express your expectations and understand your partner's needs. This mutual understanding creates a strong foundation for a healthy relationship. <br><br> I've also found that maintaining a balance between personal space and togetherness is essential. College life can be overwhelming, and it's important to respect each other's individual goals and pursuits. Encourage your partner to pursue their passions and share your own journey with them. <br><br> One valuable lesson I've learned is the significance of handling conflicts constructively. Disagreements are inevitable, but approaching them with empathy and a willingness to understand each other's perspectives can strengthen the bond. It's not about avoiding conflicts but resolving them together as a team. <br><br> Additionally, be open to new experiences and friendships outside of your relationship. College is a time for personal growth, and exploring different aspects of campus life can enrich your individual journeys. Support each other's endeavors and celebrate each other's successes. <br><br> Ultimately, every relationship is unique, and there's no one-size-fits-all formula. Be patient, be honest, and embrace the journey of self-discovery and connection. Share your experiences and learn from each other, and you'll find that college relationships can be a source of tremendous joy and growth.",
